# HW3 - CSS Cascade, Selection & Pseudo Selcectors

This repo contains the submission for MMED-1054 HW#3 by Jin Cheon.  
It is based on the in-class ToDo List as a starting point, and includes updates using generic selectors, CSS styling, and pseudo selectors such as ::before and ::after.

This project adds a background image, a styled header using an ID selector, updated fonts and colors, and checkbox inputs for list items in the “in progress” and “done” sections.

Feel free to explore the design and fonts as part of the assignment.
